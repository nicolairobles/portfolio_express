-You can attack or heal by clicking the buttons. 

-When you attack, there is a 10% chance to miss. 

-If you attack successfully, you will do between 5-30 damage. 

-When the enemy attacks, there is a 10% chance to miss. 

-If they attack successfully, you will take between 5-30 damage.

### Example Videos:

-There are two example videos in the folder. Pay careful attenton to the text being displayed and what elements are changing. 


### Getting Started: 

-You won't need to edit the pokemon.html file. You will need to look at it to get IDs and class names of elements.

-You won't need to edit the pokemon.css file. 

-Use the pokemon.js file provided to get started. (or don't)

### Bonus:

-Add animations to the game. Start by making the pokemon wiggle left and right when damaged and tip over when defeated! Like so: http://gfycat.com/InsignificantExaltedBlowfish

-Explore adding a 'damage multiplier' to the Pokemon objects. Use this to have stronger/weaker pokemon do more/less damage.
